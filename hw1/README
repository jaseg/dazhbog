This is a board designed to receive nucleo64 (and maybe 32) boards
to be test TARGETS.  The stm32l1 on _this_ board is reprogrammed via
one of the debug connectors, with appropriate software to be
master/slave/etc to correspond with the DUT.  All (most) communication
lines between the two boards are tapped to a 10 pin connector matching
cheap FX2based logic analysers, allowing automatic tests to be written
that use sigrok to check that the signals on the wire match expectations.


TODO:
Check i2c conns to target board! (drop the unused one!)
VCC routing (and recommended mic5504 routing)
ground pours in kicad
reshuffle LA conn
gerber generation?
